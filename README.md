## Overview

I know this would have been simpler with HTML/CSS but I wanted to try out a new skill I acquired which was using React. I am very new with React so this was actually quite the process for me, especially with using styled-components which is what I wanted to try instead of using CSS modules.

## My process

I used create-react-app and split the component into two parts, a reusable Card component and the second part is the content that is added to the Card component (QRCodeCard). I think my weakness is in my CSS skills and would love some feedback. I felt like I brute-forced it to look the way it does.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned:

- :root pseudoclass in CSS.
- styled-components sending styles over to another component (e.g. using the Card's component and adding onto the style in the QRCodeCard component).
- centering the div to the center of the page

### Continued development

I think I need far more work on CSS-styling and being familiar with the box model and flex display.
